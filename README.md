March Madness algorithm. I won $240 in my bracket!

I was dusting off the coding cobwebs. The data comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2024). I decided to go with a linear regression with a few interactions because, why overthink it? The goal was to see what (if anything) is statistically significant to succeed in March Madness. Winning my bracket was a bonus.

Next year: I want to adjust the algorithm for the round of 64 and 32 to better predict the first round upsets. Although predicting the later rounds has more weight, I could use some extra points predicting the big upsets in the first two rounds.
